# HIDEOUT — سيد المخبأ
### Game Design Document (working title: *HIDEOUT*)

This document organizes the full design vision into a structured reference, and tracks what
the playable prototype (`/hideout.html`) actually implements today versus what remains as
backlog for a full production. It exists so the huge original brief (74 numbered sections,
covering roughly a full commercial mobile game) has one authoritative, buildable shape instead
of being re-read from scratch every session.

**Status of this document:** vertical-slice prototype delivered. A brief this size — a
Backpack-Battles-adjacent Base-Building Roguelike-Auto-Battler with a full city, six districts,
28+ rooms, a dozen bosses, an equipment layer, and deep meta-progression — is genuinely a
multi-month, multi-person production. What follows is organized so each remaining system can be
picked up independently without re-deriving the vision.

---

## 1. Pitch & Pillars

**Fantasy:** the player is a small crime boss turning a shabby basement into a hideout that
works like a well-oiled machine — one door, two rooms, two people at the start; eventually
floors, generators, workshops, tunnels, security doors, surveillance, a large crew, income
streams, secret rooms, emergency exits.

**Core pillar — placement over power.** A player with mediocre rooms/crew but excellent layout
should be able to beat a player with stronger items but a badly-designed hideout. Numbers
(character level, weapon level) are never allowed to be the whole story; adjacency, power
budgeting, room depth (how far the Vault sits from the entrance), and crew-to-room fit are.

**The hideout is the one system everything else refers back to.** It is simultaneously
inventory, base, production line, crew housing, and battlefield. There is no separate "arena" —
a raid happens *in* the same grid the player built.

**Genre blend:** Backpack/spatial-inventory management + base building + roguelike run
structure + auto-battler combat + tactical defense + crew management + light simulation +
resource management — unified by one system (the hideout), not stitched together as separate
minigames.

---

## 2. Platform, Orientation, Controls

- Mobile-first, **portrait 9:16**, never forces landscape.
- Touch-only: tap, drag-and-drop (pointer-drag with a following ghost + snap-to-grid), press,
  long-press, pinch-zoom where relevant.
- One-thumb-reachable: primary actions live in the bottom third of the screen (bottom nav,
  build tray, phase button).
- No dependency on tiny buttons; card/room targets are sized for a fingertip.

Prototype: implemented as a single static HTML/CSS/JS page (no build step, no framework),
`max-width:480px` centered column, `100dvh` height, pointer events for build-mode placement.
This matches the pattern already used by this repo's other game (`index.html`) for easy
GitHub Pages hosting and eventual Android WebView packaging via
`.github/workflows/build-android.yml`.

---

## 3. World & Tone

Fully fictional world. Primary city (working name): **VANTA CITY** — a huge city with distinct
districts. No real cities, no real gangs, no real branding.

Tone: **Crime Cartoon** — underground, neon, humorous, stylish, urban, slightly exaggerated.
Deliberately *not* photorealistic or grim; the game should be visually fun even when the
subject matter (crime, raids, heat) is tense.

## 4. Art Direction

**"Cartoon Crime Diorama."** Characters: cartoon proportions, slightly bigger heads, small
bodies, exaggerated readable silhouettes, clear per-character shape language, slightly
over-acted animation. The hideout renders as a side-view cutaway dollhouse/diorama — the player
can always see inside every room (someone typing in the server room, a mechanic fixing a part
in the workshop, someone asleep in the bedroom, someone eating in the kitchen). The hideout
should feel *alive* even when the player isn't doing anything.

**Prototype approximation:** since a full art pipeline is out of scope for a code-only session,
the prototype renders rooms as color-coded cards (border/glow colored by category) with an
emoji icon per room type, and crew as emoji tokens that idle-drift inside their assigned room
on a slow interval, with idle bob/pulse animation on synergy/penalty triggers. This is a
placeholder that keeps the *functional* diorama-readability goal (you can see who's where and
what's active) without committing to final art direction.

## 5. Color System

Dark, modern, not grim: charcoal / dark navy / concrete-gray backgrounds with strong functional
neon accents:

| Color | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Yellow | electricity / power |
| Red | danger / defense |
| Cyan | information / tech |
| Green | health / support |
| Violet | special / advanced tech |
| Gold | economy |
| Orange | production |

Implemented as CSS custom properties (`--yellow`, `--red`, `--cyan`, `--green`, `--violet`,
`--gold`, `--orange`) and used consistently as each room category's accent border/glow color
(see §8 catalog) so the player learns the mapping passively.

---

## 6. Screen Layout

**HIDEOUT SCREEN** is the main screen:

- **Top:** a compact resource bar — Cash, Respect, Intel, Parts, Heat. Five values, no more —
  deliberately not a ten-icon dashboard.
- **Middle (~65–75% of height):** the hideout viewport — pan/scroll + pinch-zoom-ready
  container, tap a room for its bottom sheet, drag from the build tray to place rooms.
- **Bottom:** persistent nav (Hideout / Crew / City / Shop / Upgrades) outside a run-cycle
  moment, replaced conceptually during an active cycle by the contextual **phase button**
  (Shop → Build → Crew → Event → Threat → Raid → Reward) that always tells the player the one
  next action.

Implemented 1:1 in the prototype: `#resbar`, `#stage`/`#viewport`/`#grid`, `#bottomnav`,
`#phaseBtn`, `#buildBar`.

---

## 7. The Grid & Room Shapes

The hideout is a **grid** (`COLS×ROWS`, prototype uses 7×11) but the grid is only emphasized
visually in **Build Mode** — otherwise cells disappear behind the diorama art.

Base unit: **Cell**. Rooms occupy 1–6 cells in shapes: `1×1, 1×2, 2×1, 2×2, 2×3, 3×2, L, T`
(`SHAPES` table in code), all rotatable in 90° steps (`rotN`).

**Expansion is not "get a free rectangle."** When the player earns an expansion, they are
offered **3 random multi-cell shapes** and must choose one, then choose *where* to attach it —
validated so it (a) stays in bounds, (b) never overlaps the entrance or existing rooms, and
(c) must touch the already-unlocked footprint (no floating, unreachable islands). This is what
makes every run's hideout shape different even with the same room catalog.

Implemented: `EXPANSION_POOL`, `openExpansionPicker()`, `armExpansion()`, validated placement
in `expansionClickHandler()`.

---

## 8. Room Catalog

Every room carries: id, name (EN+AR), category, shape, power cost/output, crew capacity, base
effect, rarity, upgrade cost, and participates in the synergy system (§9). 28 rooms are
implemented across all seven categories from the brief:

| Category | Color | Rooms implemented |
|---|---|---|
| UTILITY | yellow | Generator, Battery Room, Ventilation, Maintenance |
| SUPPORT | green | Bedroom, Kitchen, Lounge, Clinic |
| TECH | cyan | Intel Room, Server Room, Surveillance, Hacker Lab |
| PRODUCTION | orange | Workshop, Parts Storage, Repair Bay |
| DEFENSE | red | Guard Room, Security Station, Armory |
| ECONOMY | gold | Vault, Storage, Front Business |
| SPECIAL | violet | Panic Room, War Room, Control Room, Black Market, Secret Vault |

Not yet in the prototype's data table but designed and easy to slot in with the same schema:
Trap Control, Underground Tunnel (full mechanical treatment — see §14 Traps backlog).

Each room's `desc` field carries its one-line functional description shown in its info sheet;
`cost` drives shop price; `rarity` drives shop draw weighting (`weightedRoom()`).

---

## 9. Synergy System

Rooms are never isolated. `SYN` is a data table of `{a, b, kind: bonus|penalty, label, pct,
stat}` rules; `computeRoomState()` scans every pair of **orthogonally-adjacent placed rooms**
each render and returns bonuses/penalties per room, which the economy tick (§12) reads to scale
production/healing/etc. Implemented pairs mirror the brief's examples:

- Workshop + Storage/Parts Room → faster Parts production (+20%)
- Workshop + Generator → +10% production
- Workshop + Clinic → −10% recovery (noise)
- Clinic + Bedroom → +15% recovery
- Generator + Maintenance → +15% efficiency
- Generator + Bedroom → morale penalty (noise)
- Intel Room + Control Room → better threat intel
- Armory + Guard Room → +20% defense
- Black Market + Security Station → suspicion (Heat) penalty
- Front Business + Lounge → +15% cash (good atmosphere)

Vault/Secret Vault get a special case instead of a pair rule: `distFromEntrance()` — the
farther from the entrance, the safer, shown directly in the room's info sheet as a
safe/at-risk pill. This operationalizes §17 of the brief ("vault location is a real decision")
without needing a full explicit door-graph editor yet.

Visual feedback: rooms flash a green ring (`pulseSyn`) or red ring (`pulseWarn`) and a small
▲N / ▼N badge shows bonus/penalty count on the room card, so the player can read their layout's
health without opening every sheet.

---

## 10. Power Grid

`computePower()` sums produced vs. required; `applyPowerPriority()` auto-shuts down the lowest
category-priority consuming rooms when required exceeds produced, in this order (highest
priority kept alive first): **Defense → Support → Economy → Tech → Production → Special →
Utility**. Powered-down rooms render dim (`inactive` class), stop producing/healing, and fight
at half effectiveness in a raid (`roomDefenseWeight`).

**Backlog:** a full player-facing priority *override* UI (brief §14: "Priority 1 Security,
Priority 2 Clinic...") — right now priority is a fixed category order, not player-editable.
Battery Room exists as a room and participates in the Generator+Battery synergy entry, but the
"store power for N seconds during an outage" buffer mechanic itself is not simulated yet — it's
a clear, isolated next step (give Battery a `storedPower` field, drain it before rooms shut off).

---

## 11. Doors, Hallways & the Raid Path

Rather than a separate door-placement tool, the prototype treats **any two orthogonally-adjacent
placed rooms as connected**, and any room touching the entrance as an entrance-adjacent node
(`buildGraph()`). This is the deliberate scope cut that keeps a real, working pathfinding-based
raid possible without a full door/hallway editor:

- `roomDefenseWeight(room)` gives DEFENSE-category rooms (and Guard Rooms scaled by assigned
  crew) a much higher "resistance" weight.
- `findPath(targetUid)` runs Dijkstra from the entrance to the raid's objective room, so
  attackers **actually route around your strongest defenses if a weaker path exists** — exactly
  the strategic layout tension in the brief's §17 example (a Vault directly behind the entrance
  is undefended; a Vault behind Security → Hallway → Guard Room is genuinely safer).

**Backlog:** an explicit door/trap object placed *on a connection* rather than folded into the
room's own weight (Security Door, Alarm, Barricade, EMP, Decoy Room from §53) would let door
placement be a decision independent of room placement — a natural v2 once the base loop is
validated with players.

---

## 12. Cycle Loop

Each run advances through cycles:

```
HIDEOUT → SHOP → BUILD → CREW → EVENT → THREAT PREVIEW → RAID → REWARD → next cycle
```

`advancePhase()` drives this state machine; every phase either resolves itself (an event choice
auto-advances) or exposes one clear button (`#shopDoneBtn`, `#crewDoneBtn`, `#buildExit` +
phase button, `#startRaidBtn`, `#rewardNext`) so the player is never blocked on a hidden
affordance. `runEconomyTick()` runs once per cycle (Cash/Parts/Intel production, Clinic
healing, morale drift, Heat drift) before the Event fires.

---

## 13. Crew

Characters are not cards floating in a menu — every crew member has a `room` field and is
rendered as a token physically inside that room. Schema: name, role, hp/maxHp, dmg, def,
trait `{name, desc}`, flaw `{name, desc}`, morale, loyalty, level, rarity, injured flag.

**Roles implemented:** Enforcer, Guard, Hacker, Mechanic, Medic, Scout, Driver, Fixer, Leader
(`ROLES` table) — matching §19 exactly. Recruited crew get a randomized trait/flaw pair per
role (`randomCrew()`), e.g. Enforcer → *Lone Wolf* (+30% damage alone in a room, implemented
and checked during combat) / *Short Temper*. Rarity is on the character record for future
tuning but the prototype does not yet gate raw power by rarity — see backlog.

**Backlog:** the brief's relationships graph (Friends/Rivals/Partners/Mentor/Grudge, §22) and
loyalty-driven betrayal/attrition arcs (§23) are designed but not implemented — they're a
content-and-tuning-heavy system best built once the core loop is validated, not before.

---

## 14. Raid Combat

`startRaid()` picks an objective (Vault/Generator/Intel/Workshop/Control Room/a crewed room,
weighted by what actually exists in the base — §35), resolves the shortest-resistance path to
it, and **steps room-by-room down that path on a timer** (`raidTick()`), each step:

1. Defenders assigned to that room deal damage to the attacker's pooled HP (scaled by
   category, Armory adjacency, Lone-Wolf trait, powered-down state).
2. If the attacker survives, they strike back at a random defender in that room (can injure and
   evacuate a crew member — permanent death is intentionally *not* implemented, per §55: crew
   go to `injured` state instead of dying).
3. The room is marked cleared (green outline) and the attacker advances to the next room on the
   path.

**Tactical Commands** (§32–33): the player gets a pool of 3 (4 with an active Control Room) —
Lockdown, Rally, Overclock, Medkit, Fall Back, Decoy, Emergency Power — each implemented with a
real, if simplified, combat effect (`useTactical()`), spendable live during the raid's timed
resolution, matching the brief's "≈80% auto-combat, ≈20% tactical" ratio: commands blunt or
delay, they never substitute for a good layout.

**Threat Preview** (§36) gates information behind Intel/Surveillance/War Room presence — a
base with no Intel Room only sees "something is coming," a well-built one sees the objective
and rough attacker strength.

**Loss states** are graded, not binary: partial loss on defeat (stolen cash / disabled
generator / drained intel, scaled by objective) vs. a `checkGameOver()` run-ending state only
when the whole crew is down or the base is destitute — matching §54–55's "minor / serious /
run-ending" ladder.

---

## 15. Heat & Economy

Four resources only — **Cash, Respect, Intel, Parts** — deliberately no fifth "gacha" currency,
per §44. **Heat** is a separate 0–100 risk meter (not spent) that scales raid frequency/strength
*and* rewards together (win more when Heat is high), drifts down each cycle, and rises with
district danger level and aggressive event choices — implementing the brief's risk/reward
intent directly rather than as a pure penalty.

---

## 16. City & Districts

`DISTRICTS` implements the six named zones (Old Block → Neon District → Industrial Zone →
Docks → Downtown → The Heights) as a light, functional structure: each carries a threat level
that scales raid difficulty/reward and a cycle-count gate, shown in a City tab list. Full
per-district enemy rosters, unique room unlocks, and named bosses per district (§45–51) are
**backlog** — the prototype implements one generic boss modifier (every 5th cycle is marked a
Boss raid with a damage/HP multiplier and a distinct preview banner) as a proof of the "boss
changes the rules, not just HP" intent, rather than the four fully-distinct named boss kits
(The Grid / The Twins / The Ghost / Breaker / The Collector) from §47–51.

---

## 17. Meta-Progression

Deliberately light, per §56: on a run-ending failure the player banks **Legacy** (derived from
final Respect + cycles survived) into `META` (persisted in `localStorage` under
`hideout_meta_v1`, independent of the run save), spendable in the Upgrades tab on small
permanent conveniences (currently: one extra shop/inventory-adjacent slot). This intentionally
stops short of the large permanent power multipliers the brief explicitly warns against
("don't make the first runs impossible next to later ones — skill must still matter").

Run start (§57): pick **Leader** (3 options, each a real Leader-role crew member with a
trait/flaw) → pick **Front Business** (6 options, each with a real starting-resource bonus) →
begin. Implemented in the boot/setup screen.

---

## 18. Quality-of-Life

Implemented: rotate-before-placing in Build Mode, room/crew bottom-sheet inspectors, live
synergy/penalty badges on room cards, toast feedback for every meaningful action, autosave to
`localStorage` after every state-mutating action (`save()`), resize-responsive grid sizing.

Backlog from §60: full Undo stack during Build Mode, Auto-Sort *suggestion* (explicitly not an
auto-solver, per the brief), side-by-side item Compare, item Lock in the shop, and dedicated
Power/Path/Threat map overlays (today the raid path is shown implicitly via the raid-clear
outline sequence, not a persistent overlay toggle).

---
